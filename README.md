# MSDS610_final_project
Introduction
Duration: 1.5 minutes

Welcome to our taste test experiment! In this session, we'll explore the intricacies of Coke and Pepsi preferences using a structured methodology.

Objectives:
Introduce the experiment topic.
Formulate null and alternative hypotheses.
The Experiment
Duration: 2 minutes

Taste Test:

Pass out labeled drinks (Cups A/B).
Participants conduct a silent taste test.
Each person records their preference discreetly.
Data Collection:

Collect A/B preference data.
Display results on the board.
Revelation:

Reveal which cup corresponds to each soda.
Briefly comment on the data.
Statistical Analysis
Duration: 1.5 minutes

Calculate Test Statistic:

Sample size (n): 20 (Adjusted for our setup).
Conduct a chi-squared test.
Conclusion:

Compare test statistic with critical value.
Reject or retain the null hypothesis.
Experiment Limitations
Our experiment depends on certain assumptions:

Independence of Observations: Ensured through random sampling and assignment.
Categorical Data: Both variables (Coke/Pepsi preference) are categorical.
Large Sample Size: Adequate to meet chi-squared distribution requirements.
Mutually Exclusive Categories: Each participant fits into only one category.
Note:
Data Independence: Potential issue due to selection bias.
Generalization: Applicable to our class but may not extend to the wider population.
Questions and Answers
Why Chi-Squared?
Purpose: To analyze categorical data (Coke/Pepsi preferences).
Function: Examines frequency distribution against null hypothesis expectations.
