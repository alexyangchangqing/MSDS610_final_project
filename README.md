# Experimental Soda Taste Test

## Introduction (1.5 minutes)
- **Topic:** Experimental Soda Taste Test
- **Objective:** Test preferences between cups labeled A and B.

### Setting up the Experiment
- Introduce the topic and experiment.
- Formulate null and alternative hypotheses.

## The Experiment

### Taste Test (2 minutes)
- Distribute drinks without revealing their identity.
- Participants taste and privately note their preferences.
- Ensure no communication until the end of the test.

### Data Collection (2 minutes)
- Collect A/B preference frequency data on the board.
- Reveal which cup corresponds to which soda.
- Comment briefly on the data.

### Statistical Analysis (1.5 minutes)
- Calculate test statistic and critical value.
- **Sample Size (n):** 20 participants.
- Use chi-squared test for categorical data.
- Determine if the test statistic rejects the null hypothesis.

## Conclusion

### Limitations of the Experiment
- **Independence of Observations:** Address how random sampling and assignment were used.
- **Categorical Data:** Confirm that both variables are categorical.
- **Large Sample Size:** Discuss the sufficiency of the sample size.
- **Mutually Exclusive Categories:** Ensure each participant fits into one category for both variables.

### Generalization of Results
- Acknowledge potential bias in the sample.
- Conclude that results may apply to the class and cohort.

### Potential Questions
- Why use chi-squared?
  - Explain its relevance to analyzing categorical data, specifically Coke and Pepsi preferences.
